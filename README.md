# Linked Potter
Linked data for the AO3 tags of the Harry Potter fandom with examples of charachters, relationships, and freeform tags associated to them.

Due to GitHub file size limit, the main RDF/OWL file is hosted on an external OSF repository https://osf.io/azu86

Here you can find the results of some queries that have been used for a work I've done with Alberto Acerbi and Simone Rebora on cumulative cultural evolution in online fanfiction (submitted to CHR2020).

The CSV files with the results are in the folder [queries/](queries)

I have documented the creation of the knowledge base in a paper submitted to DHJapan 2020. Here is a schematice representation:
