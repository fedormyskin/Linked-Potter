# Linked Potter
Knowledge base for the AO3 tags of the Harry Potter fandom with examples of characters, relationships, and freeform tags associated to them.

Due to GitHub file size limit, the main RDF/OWL file is hosted on an external OSF repository: https://osf.io/azu86

The simplest way to use the linked data is:
* open the .owl file with an ontology editor like [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu);
* start a reasoner so that axioms will be inferred and all data will be linked;
* look for a tag of interest and copy the other tags related to it.

Here you can find the results of some queries that have been used for a [work](https://osf.io/4wjnm/) I've done with Alberto Acerbi and Simone Rebora on cumulative cultural evolution in online fanfiction.

The CSV files with the queries' results are in the folder [/queries](queries)

I have documented the creation of the knowledge base in a paper presented at JADH2020. This is the [paper](Linked-potter_DHJapan2020.pdf), and this is a schematic representation:
